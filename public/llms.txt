## About
Sycamore Creek Consulting is a boutique retained search and talent advisory firm founded and operated by Owen Howe. The firm specializes in sourcing passive talent — candidates who are not actively looking — for high-growth startups and established institutions. Primary markets are Washington, D.C. and New York City.

The firm operates on a principal-led model: Owen Howe personally runs every engagement from scoping through offer close. There is no handoff to junior staff.

## Services

### Retained Search
End-to-end ownership of critical hires. Includes market mapping, candidate scorecard development, targeted outreach, evaluation, and offer negotiation. Best for senior technical leadership, niche engineering roles, and confidential replacements where the talent pool is small and the stakes are high.

### Embedded Recruiting
Direct integration into the client's team for a defined engagement period. Operates inside client ATS and Slack, attends standups, and functions as an extension of the internal recruiting function without the overhead of a full-time hire. Best for startups scaling rapidly after a funding round.
