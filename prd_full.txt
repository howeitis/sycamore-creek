1. Executive Summary & Deployment Model
Objective
Build three new standalone web pages — About, Services, and Contact — for Sycamore Creek
Consulting. Each page will be deployed as an independent static file and embedded via iframe into
the existing private Google Site, alongside the current homepage.
Critical Architecture Decision
These pages are NOT additional routes within the existing React SPA. Each page is a separate,
independently deployable HTML file (or lightweight React build) that Google Sites will embed via
its "Embed by URL" feature on separate Google Sites pages. This avoids all iframe routing conflicts,
enables independent deployment, and leverages Google Sites' native navigation.
Deployment Architecture
Homepage 	Existing React SPA (no changes) — embedded at
sycamorecreekconsulting.com or equivalent
About Page 	Standalone file deployed to /about or about.html — embedded on Google
Sites "About" page
Services Page 	Standalone file deployed to /services or services.html — embedded on
Google Sites "Services" page
Contact Page 	Standalone file deployed to /contact or contact.html — embedded on
Google Sites "Contact" page
Hosting 	Same Vercel/Netlify/GitHub Pages deployment as homepage
Repo 	Same sycamore-creek repository — shared styles, independent page files
Technical Constraints
• Each page must be 100% fluid (min-height: 100vh) to prevent double-scrollbars inside the
Google Sites iframe.
• Do NOT set restrictive X-Frame-Options or Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors
headers that block Google Sites from displaying the pages.
• Each page must import the same index.css (or shared stylesheet) to ensure visual
consistency with the homepage.
• All pages must be fully functional in the latest versions of Chrome, Safari, and Firefox.

-- 3 of 15 --

• Contact form must operate at $0 cost — use Formspree free tier (50 submissions/month)
or native Google Form embed.

2. Design System Reference
Extracted directly from the current homepage codebase (index.css, Hero.jsx, Pedigree.jsx,
ServiceHierarchy.jsx, Closing.jsx, Footer.jsx). All new pages must use these exact values.

Component Patterns from Homepage
The homepage establishes the following reusable patterns that the new pages should follow:
• Dark full-width hero section with overlay — used sparingly (homepage only). New pages
should use a lighter page header approach.
• Alternating background sections: Parchment (#F5F5F0) → British Racing Green
(#004225) → Parchment → Teal (#2C4C48) → White (#FFFFFF). New pages should use
this alternating rhythm.
• Proof grid cards: title in --bg-emphasis green, description in #555 gray, separated by a 1px
border-top.
• Numbered steps: 01/02/03 pattern with faded green step numbers and left-aligned text in
a 3-column grid.
• CTA button: British Racing Green background, cream text, uppercase, 4px border-radius,
hover darkens to #00331B.
• Footer: Charcoal (#333333) background, cream text, three-column flex layout (copyright |
name/title/location | email/LinkedIn).
Footer Reuse
All three new pages must include the exact same footer component as the homepage. Replicate
the Footer.jsx output identically: Sycamore Creek Consulting © 2026 | Owen Howe | Principal |
Washington, D.C. | owen@howe.app | LinkedIn.

3. Page 1: About
Page Purpose
Establish credibility, communicate the firm's philosophy, and give visitors confidence that
Sycamore Creek is a serious, premium operation backed by a principal with real experience. This
page answers: "Who is behind this firm and why should I trust them?"
Layout & Sections
Section A — Page Header
Background 	Parchment Cream (#F5F5F0)
Headline 	"Built for the searches others can't close."
Subhead 	"Sycamore Creek is a boutique talent advisory built on a single premise:
the best people aren't applying. Reaching them requires precision,
discretion, and a principal who understands your technical environment
as well as your team does."
Layout 	Left-aligned, max-width: 800px, consistent with Pedigree section styling
Section B — Founder Profile
Background 	White (#FFFFFF)
Layout 	Two-column grid (1fr 1fr), image left, text right. Collapses to stacked on
mobile.
Left Column 	Professional headshot placeholder (engineering to use a gray
placeholder box with text "Headshot" until image is provided)
Right Column — Label 	OWEN HOWE (uppercase overline label, Lato, bold, letter-spacing)
Right Column — Title 	"Founder & Principal"
Right Column — Body 	See editorial copy below
EDITORIAL COPY — FOUNDER BIO
Owen Howe is the founder and principal of Sycamore Creek Consulting. Before launching the firm,
he spent years embedded inside both high-growth startups and globally recognized institutions,
building and scaling recruiting functions from the ground up. He has hired across the full seniority
spectrum — from early-career internship cohorts to senior technical leadership — and has
operated in environments where the margin for error on a hire is effectively zero.

-- 7 of 15 --

Sycamore Creek was founded on the conviction that recruiting consulting should be a craft, not a
volume game. Owen works directly with every client engagement, bringing the same rigor to a
five-person startup building its founding team as he does to a legacy enterprise transforming its
talent strategy.
Section C — Philosophy
Background 	Parchment Cream (#F5F5F0)
Section Title 	"How We Think"
Layout 	Three-column grid matching the homepage proof-grid pattern. Collapses
to single column on mobile.
EDITORIAL COPY — PHILOSOPHY CARDS
Precision Over Volume
We don't send you fifty resumes and hope for the best. Every candidate we present has been
sourced against a detailed technical and cultural scorecard built with you before the search begins.
Principals, Not Associates
There is no handoff after the sales call. The person who scopes your search is the same person
running it, evaluating candidates, and managing your offer negotiations. That continuity is the
difference between a placed candidate and a retained one.
Market Intelligence as Standard
Every engagement produces durable knowledge — compensation benchmarks, competitor org
charts, talent density maps — that informs your hiring strategy long after the search closes.
Section D — Proof Points (Optional)
Background 	British Racing Green (#004225), text in Cream
Layout 	Horizontal flex row with 3–4 stats, centered
Guidance 	Only include if Owen provides hard numbers. Suggested format: large
number + short label (e.g., "14 Days" / "Fastest Placement"). If no stats
are provided, omit this section entirely — empty stats damage credibility
more than no stats.
Section E — Footer
Identical to homepage footer.

-- 8 of 15 --

4. Page 2: Services
Page Purpose
Clearly communicate the distinct engagement models Sycamore Creek offers so that prospective
clients can self-identify which service fits their situation. This page answers: "What exactly do you
do and how does working with you actually work?"
Layout & Sections
Section A — Page Header
Background 	Parchment Cream (#F5F5F0)
Headline 	"Different problems require different engagements."
Subhead 	"We offer a focused set of services because recruiting challenges are not
one-size-fits-all. Whether you need a single critical hire or an entire
talent function built from scratch, we structure the engagement around
the outcome — not around billing hours."
Section B — Retained Search
Background 	British Racing Green (#004225), text in Cream
Layout 	Full-width block, centered text, matching the homepage block-apex
pattern
Service Label 	"RETAINED SEARCH" (uppercase, letter-spaced)
EDITORIAL COPY
For roles where a mis-hire is not an option. We own the search end to end — from building the
market map and defining the candidate scorecard to managing every stage of outreach, evaluation,
and offer negotiation. Retained engagements are our highest-touch service: fully dedicated
bandwidth, weekly progress reporting, and a commitment to fill the role.
Best for: Senior technical leadership, niche engineering roles, confidential replacements, and any
position where the talent pool is small and the stakes are high.
Section C — Embedded Recruiting
Background 	White (#FFFFFF)

-- 9 of 15 --

Layout 	Two-column grid (matching foundation-grid pattern from homepage).
Left column: service description. Right column: "What's Included" list.
Service Label 	"EMBEDDED RECRUITING" (uppercase, teal border-bottom underline)
EDITORIAL COPY — LEFT COLUMN
We integrate directly into your team for a defined engagement period. We attend your standups,
work inside your ATS and Slack, run intake sessions with your hiring managers, and operate as a
seamless extension of your internal recruiting function — without the overhead of a full-time hire.
Best for: Startups scaling rapidly after a funding round, companies without an internal recruiting
team, or any organization facing a surge in hiring volume that their current team cannot absorb.
EDITORIAL COPY — RIGHT COLUMN (WHAT'S INCLUDED)
• Dedicated sourcing and screening aligned to your technical stack
• Intake and calibration sessions with every hiring manager
• Pipeline management inside your existing tools
• Weekly reporting on pipeline health, conversion rates, and market feedback
• Offer strategy and negotiation support
Section D — Strategic Advising
Background 	Sycamore Teal (#2C4C48), text in Cream
Layout 	Full-width centered block, matching block-diff pattern
Service Label 	"STRATEGIC ADVISING" (uppercase, letter-spaced)
EDITORIAL COPY
Not every hiring problem is solved by adding a recruiter. Sometimes the problem is the process
itself — the interviews are too slow, the offers are uncompetitive, or the employer brand isn't
reaching the right people. We advise leadership on the structural and strategic dimensions of
talent acquisition: compensation architecture, interview design, employer positioning, and
organizational planning for teams in transition.
Best for: Founders losing candidates and unsure why, HR teams seeking an outside perspective,
and leadership navigating AI-driven workforce restructuring.
Section E — CTA Block
Background 	Parchment Cream (#F5F5F0)

-- 10 of 15 --

Layout 	Centered text block with CTA button, matching Closing section pattern
Headline 	"Not sure which engagement fits? Let's talk."
CTA Button 	"GET IN TOUCH" — links to Contact page URL. British Racing Green
button, cream text, consistent with homepage CTA.
Section F — Footer
Identical to homepage footer.

-- 11 of 15 --

5. Page 3: Contact
Page Purpose
Provide a clean, low-friction way for prospective clients to reach Owen directly. This page
answers: "How do I start a conversation?"
Layout & Sections
Section A — Page Header
Background 	Parchment Cream (#F5F5F0)
Headline 	"Every engagement starts with a conversation."
Subhead 	"Tell us what you're trying to build and we'll tell you how we can help. No
pitch decks, no pressure — just a direct conversation with the principal."
Section B — Contact Form + Direct Info
Background 	White (#FFFFFF)
Layout 	Two-column grid. Left column: contact form. Right column: direct contact
information. Collapses to stacked on mobile.
LEFT COLUMN — CONTACT FORM
Four fields maximum, vertically stacked:
• Name (required)
• Email (required)
• Company (optional)
• "How can we help?" — free-text textarea (required)
Submit button: "SEND MESSAGE" — styled identically to homepage CTA button (British Racing
Green, cream text, uppercase).
Form Backend Options (Select One)
Option A (Recommended) 	Formspree free tier — 50 submissions/month, $0 cost. Submissions
forward directly to owen@howe.app. Integrate via form action attribute
or JavaScript fetch.

-- 12 of 15 --

Option B 	Embed a native Google Form directly on the Google Sites page instead of
inside the iframe. This avoids any backend entirely but sacrifices visual
consistency with the brand.
RIGHT COLUMN — DIRECT CONTACT
For visitors who prefer to reach out directly rather than fill out a form:
• Email: owen@howe.app (mailto link)
• LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/owen-howe-wm2016/ (opens in new tab)
• Location line: "Based in Washington, D.C. Working with clients nationwide."
Style the email and LinkedIn as simple text links with hover underline, consistent with footer link
styling. The location line should use muted gray (#555) body copy.
Section C — Footer
Identical to homepage footer.

6. Engineering Checklist & Acceptance Criteria
Pre-Development Checklist
• Confirm deployment approach: three separate HTML files (about.html, services.html,
contact.html) in the same repo, or three separate Vite entry points. Either approach is
acceptable; confirm with product before starting.
• Confirm shared CSS strategy: all pages import the same index.css for CSS custom
properties and base styles. Page-specific styles can be scoped within each file.
• Confirm Formspree account setup and endpoint URL (or decision to use Google Form
fallback).
• Confirm that Vercel/Netlify deployment config serves all three pages without restrictive
iframe headers.
Acceptance Criteria
Test Case 1: Visual Consistency
All three pages must use the exact color palette, typography, and component patterns
documented in Section 2. A side-by-side comparison with the homepage should show clear visual
family membership. Fonts (Merriweather + Lato) must load correctly. The footer on every page
must be pixel-identical to the homepage footer.
Test Case 2: Google Sites Iframe Embedding
Each page must render correctly when embedded via Google Sites "Embed by URL" feature. No
double-scrollbars. No blocked-by-frame-policy errors. The page must fill the iframe container
fluidly using min-height: 100vh.
Test Case 3: Responsive Behavior
All pages must render correctly at desktop (1200px+), tablet (768px–1199px), and mobile (below
768px). Two-column grids must collapse to single-column stacks. Typography must scale
appropriately. Navigation and CTAs must remain tappable on mobile.
Test Case 4: Contact Form Submission
Submitting the contact form with valid data must deliver the submission to owen@howe.app
within 60 seconds. The form must show a confirmation state after successful submission (e.g.,
"Thank you — we'll be in touch within 24 hours."). The form must show a clear error state if
required fields are empty.

-- 14 of 15 --

Test Case 5: Cross-Browser
All pages must function correctly in the latest versions of Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. No layout
breaks, missing fonts, or non-functional form elements.
Test Case 6: Performance
Each page must achieve a Lighthouse performance score of 90+ on desktop. Total page weight
(excluding external font requests) should stay under 200KB per page.
